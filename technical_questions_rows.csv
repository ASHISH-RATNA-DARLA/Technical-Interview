16,What are the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming?,short_answer,OOP,easy,OOP Fundamentals,,,,,,,"The four pillars are: 1) Encapsulation - bundling data and methods together, 2) Inheritance - creating new classes based on existing ones, 3) Polymorphism - same interface for different data types, 4) Abstraction - hiding complex implementation details."
17,Which OOP concept allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name?,mcq,OOP,easy,Polymorphism,Inheritance,Encapsulation,Polymorphism,Abstraction,C,Polymorphism allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (method overloading) or different implementations in derived classes (method overriding).,"[""Method overloading and overriding"", ""Same name, different behavior"", ""Compile-time and runtime polymorphism"", ""Flexibility in method implementation""]"
18,Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.,short_answer,OOP,medium,Polymorphism,,,,,,,Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (compile-time polymorphism).
